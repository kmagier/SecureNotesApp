# SecureNotesApp
Very simple app created for Data Security in IT classes.

Purpose of the project was to create a simple application allowing short notes publishing, with focus on security, i.e.: passwords protected with salt, form validation, using HTTPS protocol and self-signed certificates.

All data is stored in Redis database, as it is only for demonstration purposes.
